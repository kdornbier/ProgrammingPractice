Final Group Project, Good 4 U+I
Human-Computer Interaction
University of Iowa
*******************************

This project was a basic web-application high-fidelity prototype for a nutrition app geared towards low-income users. It is written in regular Bootstrapped html with javascript functionality to simulate key user tasks for testing purposes. 

To run, open the folder containing the html files and open signUp.html. The sign up page should load on your local browser and allow navigation between the other html files (any other page can also be opened via the folder, or by changing the local browser url).

The application can also be accessed with the url

*******************************

To simulate the demo from class, proceed through the following steps:
Task 1 - Sign Up and Login
1. From signUp.html, make a new account with 
         username: ‘hci’
         email: ‘hci@msn.com’
         password: ‘chi’.
2. Make a person named Laura who is gluten intolerant
3. Save Laura
4. Add and save another family member named Kaitlyn who is vegan
5. Set your grocery store preference as ‘always closest’
6. Go to homepage via menu or home icon on header bar
7. Log out
8. Log in with the account previously created (username: hci: password: hci)

Task 2 - Search and favorite
1. Search for ‘chicken’
2. Select a few chicken meals to add to favorites
3. Check favorites to make sure selections were added
4. Remove one item from favorites list
5. Return to popular meals
6. Cancel search for ‘chicken’

Task 3 - Adding and removing items from cart
1. View detailed information for chocolate cake
2. Add one chocolate cake to cart
3. Go to cart through menu or cart quick button on header
4. Make sure chocolate cake has been added to cart
   optional - may toy with ingredient increment/decrement
5. Remove the chocolate cake from cart
6. Return to homepage
7. Add chicken to cart from homepage
8. Go to cart
9. Compare prices of current cart via current store name or compare button
10. Sort the grocery stores by cheapest and change preferred store to cheapest
11. Save current grocery list (via Save icon at top)
12. View saved lists via menu or button
13. Select list that was just saved
14. Navigate to ‘Go Shop!’ 

Moving around the website without following these direct instructions will still appear to work, as most functionality will simulate correctly on individual pages. However, because not every case is implemented (i.e. cannot search for ‘cake’, add ‘pasta’ to cart, or select the most expensive grocery store option), some transitions between pages will not function correctly.
