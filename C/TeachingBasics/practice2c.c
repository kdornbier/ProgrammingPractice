/* 

	Write a program that will:
	
	1. Ask the user for two variables, x and y
	2. Print out the values of x and y
	3. Ask the user for THE SAME x and y again
	4. Print out the new values for x and y
	5. Print out the addition, subtraction, and
	   multiplication of the two
	6. Print out the value of (x * y) + (x - y) * y
	7. Print out the value of x-squared and y-cubed

	Bonus:
	1. Find the division of the two
	      Hint* For divison, decimals are often used.
		  When using doubles scan in with %lf
          and print with %f as follows		  
		  scanf("%lf", &x) printf("%f", x);

	Double Bonus: 
    2. Find the remainder of x divided by y
          Hint* the mod operator % does such function
          What does (x % y) and (y % x) output?
